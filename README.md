### Hi there 👋

I am Music University graduate 🎹 and I am striving to start my professional career in the IT sector as softwaretester. 
To develop my testing skills 💪 I read literature on testing, I do test projects, I learn about tools supporting the testing process and 
I am learning JAVA language to run automated tests. I finished the course for novice testers organised by testerzy.pl company. 
I want to get ISTQB certification in the future.
